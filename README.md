________________________________
A basic management system to keep track of business-related resources.


<!-- Add a cover/banner image for your README. **Why?** Because it easily **grabs people's attention** and it **looks cool**(*duh!obviously!*).
The best dimensions for the banner is **1280x650px**. You could also use this for social preview of your repo.
I personally use [**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/) for creating the banner images. All the basic stuff is **free**(*you won't need the pro version in most cases*). -->



# Demo-Preview
<!-- Add a demo for your project -->

<!-- After you have written about your project, it is a good idea to have a demo/preview(**video/gif/screenshots** are good options) of your project so that people can know what to expect in your project. You could also add the demo in the previous section with the product description.

Here is a random GIF as a placeholder. -->

<!-- This is to give people an idea how they can raise issues or feature requests in your projects. 

You could also give guidelines for submitting and issue or a pull request to your project.

Personally and by standard, you should use a [issue template](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) and a [pull request template](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/blob/master/PULL_REQ_TEMPLATE.md)(click for examples) so that when a user opens a new issue they could easily format it as per your project guidelines.

You could also add contact details for people to get in touch with you regarding your project. -->
